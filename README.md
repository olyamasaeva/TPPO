# Title: Sensors Data Analysis for PetrSU Course Project

## Introduction:
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our university course project on Sensors Data Analysis! This project is part of our academic curriculum, aimed at exploring the world of sensor signal data and applying data analysis techniques to gain valuable insights. Here, you'll find all the resources, code, documentation, and findings related to our exploration and analysis.

## Project Overview:
In this project, we have recieved real data from local factory from such sensors as Accelerometer. The main aim was to undestand the damage of the factory equipment  in real-time by the data from sensors.Our tasks were to understand the patterns, trends, and anomalies present in the sensor data, enabling us to make data-driven decisions and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw sensor signal data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Uncovering patterns, distributions, and correlations in the sensor data.
- Visualization: Priting scalogram and signal spectrum by the plotly library
- Machine Learning Techniques: Exploring machine learning models for predicting sensor values and anomaly detection.
- Data Interpretation: Interpreting results and drawing meaningful conclusions from the analysis.

## Project Structure:
 - data: Contains the raw and processed sensor data used for the analysis.
 - notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis and code implementation.
 - scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning models.
 - documentation: Project report, presentation slides, and other related documents.
 - build: Project working folder
 - template: Template of project output


## Getting Started:
 - git clone https://github.com/your-username/sensors-data-analysis.git
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
 - python3 .scripts/create_executable.py
 - cd dist
 - ./MeasureAnalysis <path to file.csv>
Explore the notebooks in the notebooks directory to follow the analysis and reproduce the results.
Use the scripts in the scripts directory to apply specific data preprocessing or modeling tasks.
